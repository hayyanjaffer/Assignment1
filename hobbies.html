    <h1><strong>Playing Cricket</strong></h1>
    <p>
        What is Cricket? Cricket is a game of strategy between two teams. Each team bats and fields in turn â€“ the
        batters try to score runs; the fielders try to stop them. The team with the most runs wins.</p>

    <h2><strong>Fortnite</strong></h2>
    <p>Fortnite distinguishes itself with cartoon-style graphics and unique construction mechanics, but the premise is
        familiar. Your goal is to be the last person, squad, or team left alive in a round. That's easier said than
        done, of course, since each match includes 99 other players, all of whom have the same goal.</p>
