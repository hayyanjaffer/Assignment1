    <h2><strong>Home Alone</strong></h2>
    <p>Home Alone is a 1990 American Christmas comedy film directed by Chris Columbus and written and produced by John
        Hughes. The first film in the Home Alone franchise, the film stars Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern,
        John Heard, and Catherine O'Hara. Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, a boy who defends his suburban Chicago home
        from burglars after his family accidentally leaves him behind on their Christmas vacation to Paris.
        Hughes conceived Home Alone while on vacation, with Warner Bros. being originally intended to finance and
        distribute the film. However, Warner Bros. shut down production after it exceeded its assigned budget. 20th
        Century Fox assumed responsibilities following secret meetings with Hughes. Columbus and Culkin were hired soon
        afterwards. Filming took place between February and May 1990 on location across Illinois.</p>
