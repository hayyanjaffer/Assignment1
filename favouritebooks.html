    <h2>The Hounds of Baskervilles</h2>
    <p>The Hound of the Baskervilles is the third of the four crime novels by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle
        featuring the detective Sherlock Holmes. Originally serialised in The Strand Magazine from August 1901 to April
        1902, it is set in 1889 largely on Dartmoor in Devon in England's West Country and tells the story of an
        attempted murder inspired by the legend of a fearsome, diabolical hound of supernatural origin. Holmes and
        Watson investigate the case. This was the first appearance of Holmes since his apparent death in "The Final
        Problem", and the success of The Hound of the Baskervilles led to the character's eventual revival.
